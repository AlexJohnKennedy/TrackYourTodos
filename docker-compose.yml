# Define our 'services'. These become the hostnames for each container which runs the service
# inside the docker-compose virtual network, allowing our containers to address each other!
# This also defines the images that docker-compose with run as containers at the same time
# when we do 'docker-compose up'.
services:
  # React app production build, served statically on port 3000
  # NOTE: FOR Google Auth to work, when running the containers locally, we need to use xip.io
  # to resolve a wildcard ip address so that google actually lets us auth. Google doesn't support
  # public ip addresses, so 192.168.99.100:3000 won't work directly, find the app on:
  # http://www.192.168.99.100.xip.io:3000/
